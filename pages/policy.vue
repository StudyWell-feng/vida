    <h3>3、How We Process Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use analytics services to understand how users engage with our products. Our analysis relies on your consistent device identifier, or identifier for vendor (IDFV) on Apple devices, so that we can track your behavior over time and develop an understanding of how you prefer to interact with our products. If you have more than one product installed on your device, those products may share the same identifier value. This enables us to develop an understanding of how you engage with all of the products you have installed. The identifier value is provided through the operating system on your device. In the course of processing your data, we may do any of the following:</p>
    <p>Analyze your behavior in our products over time;</p>
    <p>Analyze your behavior in aggregate;</p>
    <p>Combine your information with the information of other players to create anonymized aggregate reports that allow us to understand large-scale behavior trends;</p>
    <p>Analyze your information to understand how well our products perform on your device or to investigate bugs, crashes, and other technical issues;</p>
    <p>Combine your information with the information of other players to create customer segments based on behavior in our products or location-based behavior;</p>
    <p>Utilize analysis of your behavior in our products to provide you with customized gameplay experiences;</p>
    <p>Utilize your device identifier to enroll you in an A/B test. An A/B test is a type of simple behavioral experiment wherein groups of users are provided with slightly different experiences in our products so that we can research and analyze which of the experiences is the most compelling to users of our products; </p>
    <p>European Economic Area (EEA) Only:</p>
    <p>Per requirements under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we log your consent state for compliance purposes. This information is stored on servers hosted in the EU and is used solely for GDPR compliance. Your device identifier is stored along with your consent status. If you consent to personalized advertising, your device advertising identifier is also stored in case we need to be able to access it to assist you with data portability or erasure requests. Your device advertising identifier is not stored in our consent logging database if you do not consent to personalized advertising.</p>

    <h3>4、Age, Children</h3>
    <p>We consider ourselves to be family – oriented, and we take the privacy and safety of players below the age limit, as required by the applicable data protection legislation ("Children/Child "), under special consideration. Hence we have implemented higher protection standards to ensure this. Even though our products and services are not primarily directed towards, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children, with the sole exception of online identifiers, we have decided to voluntarily implement higher child protection standards, as described in this section.</p>
    <p>If we learn that we have collected personal information, other than online identifiers, of children, we will take all reasonable steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at support@partypop.club</p>
    <p>To preserve the family-friendly reputation of our Games, we have implemented age-gating for certain features, making them unavailable are not available for use by children.</p>

    <p>partypop has a policy of retaining the information we collect for a maximum period of 180 days. During this time, we may modify and combine the data in a way that it no longer personally identifies individuals. We may keep the de-identified aggregate data products for longer than the retention period to support critical business needs.</p>
